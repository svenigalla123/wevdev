		<h2>How to make unicorn slime:</h2>
		<h3>Here is a video</h3>
			<p>First you need a 1/2 of glue. Next add a bit of baking soda and then you can add your Contact Lens Solution!!! Or you can add one spoon of Tide Detergent. Immediately, your glue will start to mix with the Contact Lens Solution or Tide Detergent and turn to slime. Stir the slime ingredients around until most of the contact solution is mixed in, and then get your hands in there and start kneading it. </p>
